      "When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?\n",

      "I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last.\n",

      "If you are interested in learning what happens at sea when boredom, monotony, ennui  and endless accounts of filler material taken from every one of the good, action packed adventures that began this series then this is the book for you. I happen to like learning what a day may have looked like at sea in that era but not to the extent that it is all that we learn about over all the pages except the last thirty when the action begins but is broken with an abrupt ending. Of course the action resumes where it left off at the beginning of the next book. In what is rapidly becoming a dissatisfying series, this is the supreme example of dissatisfaction up to this point in my opinion. As usual, I cant fault the writing but the point of this story seems to have been to sell one more book no matter the consequences of not providing an entertaining story. When I first read this series I thought every one of them was a masterpiece of naval historical work. Now that Ive been hooked by the genre, I can say many more recent writers have exceeded these last few books in story telling quality. Two that immediately come to mind are Dewey Lambdin and Jay Worrell. From the same timeframe when OBrian was writing, I value Dudley Popes work more highly. Considering my lack of memory of what the rest of the series holds I hope my opinion of these last few books is dispelled by those remaining. Like the last book, you could completely skip this one without losing anything in the overall storyline.\n",

We waited about an hour and twenty minutes for a table for two. The food was everything I hoped it would be and more: homemade sour pickles and a fried chicken-egg-bacon-cheese biscuit with cheesy grits for me, and the chicken and pancakes with an extra chocolate chip banana biscuit for my friend. Everything tasted extremely fresh and delicious AND was delivered to our table in a timely manner, despite the fact that the restaurant was insanely busy. Dare I say this place could turn me into a pickle-obsessed freak? I've never been a huge fan of pickles but they were amazing here and I gobbled them up like they were going out of style. I'll be back at some point but I don't think I'd want to wait nearly 1.5 hours every time I want brunch. Come here before the Sunday rush - Ã‚Â but definitely make sure you get over to Jacob's Pickles as soon as humanly possible.\n",

I think this place is a little over-the-top though due to shameless shilling of the sponsor country, and I don't find it easy to navigate during peak rush hours. Ã‚Â The food is delish though--so far I've eaten at the fish counter, the roasted meats counter, the coffee bar, and the chocolate/confections bar. Ã‚Â Everything is well-made and tastes great; BUT this is a place for expense accounts only (does anyone even have one of these anymore??). Ã‚Â Very pricey food--lunch will cost $20-$30 at least, and that's if you order from the counter and eat standing up.\n",

BRUNCH REVIEW Have you ever woken up feeling pretty good and then ATE A SHIT TON OF FOOD with a ginger margarita and felt so stuffed that you wanted to punt a fat kitten? I had the six pound huevos rancheros (very authentic tasty and amazerblade according to the ranchero connoisseur I was with) and a healthy sized ginger margarita--- I couldn't finish either. My friend opted for the traditional griddled eggs with bacon and a biscuit(?). I was in a harf daze, especially after our heavy app of doughnut thingers with quince jam. Me: harf harf harf harf harf harf harf dranks, talks, laughs, probably spittlin' a little bit. Dining companion: gently harfing, pretending he doesn't see me spittle, using his fork AND knife to cut things. Me: harf harf harf harf... oh my I am really full. *half-burp while holding my hand to my chest* Dining companion: (worried brow look) Are you okay? Me: Oh YEAH, harf harf harf harf harf harf---- yummerz. WARNING MORTALS: make a reservation. They do take those.

      "Original text: We had high expectations for this place, not just because of the reviews, but because we had such fabulous food everywhere we went on our NYC vacation, concentrating on the Village and lower downtown this trip. The Little Owl was the least fabulous. We were over the worst of our sticker shock by the time we got there, but I guess the bottom line is that the food was good but didn't match the prices. I was expecting a neighborhood place, which in my mind meant more modest in cost and that wasn't the case. I had the chicken dish, OK, not an exciting choice, and it was fine. My husband was warned that the special fish of the day had a lot of bones; he decided he wanted the other fish, which was served whole, not filleted and had lots and lots of bones. He's a expert filleter himself, so no problems, Ã‚Â but it's odd they didn't mention it. Ã‚Â We were going to a play and wanted to get out quick once we were through eating but had a hard time getting the check. So...a few service problems, good but not wonderful food, and a mighty big bill.\n",

      "I am stunned at the amount of high reviews. The decor is fine and there are some good ideas on the menu, but the execution is terrible. Also the service was fine but slow (20 minutes to get a refill on a non-cocktail beverage, really?). Ã‚Â I admit that I had high expectations. Ã‚Â I really wanted to like this place. Ã‚Â It is in my neighborhood, and I had been meaning to go for a year and finally got around to it on my birthday. Ã‚Â But, the mains were so underwhelming, especially for the price point. Ã‚Â The donut and frogs legs apps were fine. Nothing special and small. Ã‚Â The mains were terrible. Ã‚Â Just awful. Ã‚Â We had the Mahi Mahi and basque-etti. Ã‚Â Both had 0 seasoning. Ã‚Â Absolutely 0 salt or spices or flavor. Ã‚Â The fish was criminally overcooked and the skin was soggy. Ã‚Â Do the chefs hate seasoning? Ã‚Â As for the Basque-etti (maybe not the name?). Ã‚Â I ordered this dish because I thought it would be delicious. Ã‚Â I am not vegan. I just wanted a tasty pasta dish. Ã‚Â You can really judge the talent of a chef on how well they can achieve flavor in vegan cuisine. Ã‚Â Well they totally failed. Ã‚Â It tasted like nothing. Ã‚Â Like water (except the 4 small mushrooms those were prepared well but there was only 4). Ã‚Â The noodles were also way overdone. We spent 85 bucks on 2 small appetizers, 2 flavorlish mains, and we didn't even have drinks. Ã‚Â  I will never go back. Ã‚Â There are tons of amazing places to eat in BedStuy, Fort Greene, and Bushwich. Save your money and your time. Ã‚Â Go enjoy delicious food elsewhere in the area.\n",
